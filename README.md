# How to update your version of this template

We don't plan to make big changes on this template anymore. The only important change we did was to update the ODK version used in the [GitHub Action](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/dashboard-template/blob/ddde5f42bb2638ed3b07e781923a2a7e3285cc31/.github/workflows/dashboard.yaml#L13-L15
) that updates the dashboard.

```yaml
dashboard:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container: obolibrary/odkfull:latest
```

The easiest way to update your repository is to do so manually. Please update the ODK version to have the latest changes on the OBO Dashboard.

## If the GitHub Action is failing...

1. We experienced a failure on the GitHub Action in the step to create the pull request with the dashboard changes. To fix the issue, please update the `peter-evans/create-pull-request` version to `v6`.

```yaml
 - name: Create Pull Request
   uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v6
   with:
    commit-message: Update dashboard run
    title: 'Update dashboard run'
    body: |
        Updates the Custom OBO Dashboard
```
